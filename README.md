# PyPassword Generator

This is a simple Python-based password generator that creates secure passwords with user-defined lengths, including letters, symbols, and numbers. The user can specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers to include in the password, and the program will generate a randomized password accordingly.

## Features

- **Randomized Password Generation**: Generates passwords by shuffling randomly chosen letters, symbols, and numbers.
- **Customizable Length**: You can choose how many letters, symbols, and numbers should appear in the password.
- **Secure Passwords**: The generated passwords contain a mix of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), symbols, and numbers, making them strong and secure.
